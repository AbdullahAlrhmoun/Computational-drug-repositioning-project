# Computational-drug-repositioning-project
This prject was part of my master degree, I was trying to create a model that can predict new uses of existing drugs (known as drug repositioning or drug repurposing) using dataset been collected as raw data and preprocessed, cleaned, and normalized to be suitable for model building.
